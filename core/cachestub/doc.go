// Package cachestub provides functionality for managing a cache with batch operations and transactions.
//
// The package includes two main structures: BatchCacheStub and TxCacheStub.
// BatchCacheStub is used for managing a batch of operations on the cache,
// while TxCacheStub represents a transactional cache for a specific transaction.
// These structures provide methods for putting, getting, and deleting key-value pairs,
// as well as for committing the changes to the underlying storage.
